## ðŸ’» Way-Edges

- remove wayland-client crate, use gdk for monitor watch instead
- move `ring` and `text` from common widgets to `boxed widgets`
- update font related schema.
- fix: schema issues. The configuration JsonSchema is working as it should be now.
- fix: box y input region and transformation. Box widget should be stable now.
